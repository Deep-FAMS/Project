# Project

```
Relevant comment from Piazza[@67](https://piazza.com/class/kjlukyos8x238f?cid=67):
(1) Your chosen project does not have to come from those two specific reproducibility sites; those are just excellent starting points. 

(2) It's important that your project (a) include a significant deep learning component, and (b) go outside the scope of the course.  So if your project idea is strongly related to, say, a homework exercise in terms of scope, techniques used, etc., then it's probably insufficient.  If a paper from paperswithcode satisfies (a) and (b), then you're probably fine with taking their code, data, and repeating their experiments.  Then you'll need to assess whether your results match theirs (statistical significance tests can help here).
